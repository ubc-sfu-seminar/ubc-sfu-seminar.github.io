# About

The UBC/SFU Joint Statistics Seminar is jointly hosted by the graduate students of the [UBC Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) and the [SFU Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html). The event has offered Statistics and Actuarial Science graduate and undergraduate students at both schools an opportunity to network with their peers and to attend accessible talks about the research work of their fellow students and faculty.
